#### Prerequisites
You should know how to run gulp. If you are not familiar with it, here is a list of things you must have installed in order to use gulp.
- node.js v6+ (recommended) (http://nodejs.org/)
- npm v3+ (recommended) (https://www.npmjs.com/)
- gulp v3.9+ (http://gulpjs.com/)

#### Planned features
- Migrate to gulp 4.0 once it is released
- Reimplement JS testing
- Generated styleguides with hologram or similar

#### Installation
1. Download the zip and place its contents where you want to use them

2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where gulpfile.js lies.

3. Next, install the npm dependencies. Type the following in your command prompt and hit enter:
  ```bash
    npm install
  ```

4.  Now's the time to set your options. You can find them under `gulp/options.js`. Be sure to set `destination` and `webroot` variables to your liking, these are the most important.

5.  To initially build your assets, create the folder structure and test the installation, run:
  ```bash
    gulp build
  ```

6. If `gulp build` finished without errors, you are good to go. Run `gulp` to start developing:
  ```bash
    gulp
  ```
  
  Your development files are stored at `/src`. The built assets will be stored at `/dist` by default.
  
If you work on windows and run into `node-gyp rebuild errors`, this pages might help resolve the issue. It can have many causes, here are a few listed with resources to help you resolve these issues:
 - python not installed or set in PATH (https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/4047)
 - wrong Visual Studio version configured in node (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14278417/cannot-install-node-modules-that-require-compilation-on-windows-7-x64-vs2012)
