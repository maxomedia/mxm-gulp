#### Prerequisites
You should know how to run gulp. If you are not familiar with it, here is a list of things you must have installed to use gulp.
- node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
- npm (https://www.npmjs.com/)
- gulp (http://gulpjs.com/)

#### Installation
1. Download the zip or clone the repository (mind the dot at the end of the command, if you want to clone to current     directory):
  ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/maxomedia/mxm-gulp.git .
  ```

2. Next, install the npm dependencies with:
  ```shell
    $ npm install
  ```

3.  Now's the time to set your options. You can find them under `gulpfile.js/options.js`. Be sure to set `destination` and `webroot` variables to your liking, these are the most important.

4.  To initially build your assets, create the folder structure and test the installation, run:
  ```shell
    $ gulp stage
  ```

5. If `gulp stage` finished without errors, you are good to go. Run `gulp` to start developing:
  ```shell
    $ gulp
  ```
